Hi There,

This Project is one of the projects I will be building to keep myself updated with React.js

 ## Installation

- Clone or Download this project 
- Run `yarn install --all` to install all dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to start the project


## How it works 
- 1-9 stars are randomly displayed
- You select a combination of numbers that match the number of stars displayed
- Click on the button above the button that displays `5` to check if the answers you have provided are correct.
- if no, you can unselect any of the numbers that have been selected by clicking on them.
- If the combination of the answers selected match the number of stars displayed, then the stars are shuffled again and you repeat the process again until you have selected all the numbers

#### How to win
- Use all the numbers available as correct answers
- if you do not want to select any answers for a given number of stars, you can redraw the stars by clicking on the redraws button (the button with number `5`).

#### When do you loose
- The game will be over if the following are met:
* No more `redraws` left
* The number of `unused` numbers cannot be combined to complete the number of stars displayed
